Introduction:

# Explain what are objects in JavaScript and how they are used to store and manipulate data.

# Give some examples of common objects in JavaScript, such as String, Array, Date, etc.

# Introduce the document and window objects as two special objects that represent the web page and the browser window respectively.

# Mention that the document and window objects are often used to access and modify the HTML elements and the browser environment.

Document Object:

# Explain that the document object represents the HTML document that is loaded in the browser.
# Mention that the document object is a property of the window object and can be accessed with window.document or just document.
# List some of the properties and methods of the document object that are commonly used, such as:
  document.body: returns the <body> element of the document.
  document.title: returns or sets the title of the document.
  document.getElementById(): returns the element with the specified id attribute.
  document.createElement(): creates a new element with the specified tag name.
  document.addEventListener(): attaches an event handler to the document or an element.
# Give some examples of how to use the document object to manipulate the HTML elements, such as changing their style, content, or attributes.

Window Object:

# Explain that the window object represents the browser window that contains the document.
# Mention that the window object is the global object in JavaScript and all global variables and functions are properties of it.
#List some of the properties and methods of the window object that are commonly used, such as:
  window.innerWidth and window.innerHeight: return the width and height of the browser windowâ€™s viewport.
  window.location: returns or sets the URL of the current document.
  window.alert(), window.prompt(), and window.confirm(): display dialog boxes to interact with the user.
  window.open() and window.close(): open and close new browser windows or tabs.
  window.setTimeout() and window.setInterval(): execute a function after a specified delay or repeatedly.
#Give some examples of how to use the window object to interact with the browser environment, such as navigating to a different URL, displaying messages, or creating timers.

Conclusion:

# Summarize the main points of your blog and highlight the differences between document and window objects in JavaScript.

# Provide some tips or best practices for using document and window objects effectively, such as: 
                  Avoid using global variables or functions as they may conflict with other scripts or libraries. 
                  Use strict mode to prevent errors or bugs caused by implicit declarations or conversions.
                  Use querySelector() or querySelectorAll() methods to select elements using CSS selectors instead of using getElementById() or getElementsByTagName().
                  Use addEventListener() method to attach event handlers instead of using inline attributes such as onclick or onmouseover
